=head1 NAME

Chemistry::File::Dumper - Read and write molecules via Data::Dumper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Chemistry::File::Dumper;

    my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read("mol.pl");
    print $mol->print(format => dumper);
    $mol->write("mol.pl", format => "dumper");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module hooks the Data::Dumper Perl core module to the Chemistry::File
API, allowing you to dump and undump Chemistry::Mol objects easily.
This module automatically registers the "dumper" format with Chemistry::Mol.

For purposes of automatic file type guessing, this module assumes that
dumped files end in C<.pl>.

This module is useful mainly for debugging purposes, as it dumps I<all> the 
information available in an object, in a reproducible way (so you can use
it to compare molecule objects). However, it wouldn't be a good idea to use it
to read untrusted files, because they may contain arbitrary Perl code.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options can be used when writing a molecule either as
a file or as a string.

=over 4

=item dumper_indent

Value to give to Data::Dumper::Indent. Default is 1.

=item dumper_purity

Value to give to Data::Dumper::Purity. Default is 1.

=back

There are no special options for reading.
